<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> May 16, 2025</p>

<p>This privacy policy applies to all apps (hereby referred to as the "Application") for mobile devices that were created by sappicmind (hereby referred to as the "Service Provider") as an ad-supported service. This service is provided "AS IS".</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide location-based features or recommendations</li>
  <li>Improve services through aggregated and anonymized analytics</li>
  <li>Support third-party integrations (e.g., ad personalization)</li>

<h2>Third-Party Access</h2>
